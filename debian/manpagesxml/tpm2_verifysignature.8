.SH NAME
tpm2_verifysignature\ - uses loaded keys to validate a signature on a message with the message digest
passed to the TPM. If the signature check succeeds, then the TPM will produce
a TPMT_TK_VERIFIED. Otherwise, the TPM shall return TPM_RC_SIGNATURE. If
keyHandle references an asymmetric key, only the public portion of the key
needs to be loaded. If keyHandle references a symmetric key, both the public
and private portions need to be loaded.

.B tpm2_verifysignature
uses loaded keys to validate a signature on a message with the message digest
passed to the TPM. If the signature check succeeds, then the TPM will produce
a TPMT_TK_VERIFIED. Otherwise, the TPM shall return TPM_RC_SIGNATURE. If
keyHandle references an asymmetric key, only the public portion of the key
needs to be loaded. If keyHandle references a symmetric key, both the public
and private portions need to be loaded.

[\fBCOMMON OPTIONS\fR ]
This collection of options are common to many programs and provide
information that many users may expect.
.TP
\fB\-h,\ \-\-help\fR
Display a manual describing the tool and its usage.
.TP

Display version information for this tool.
.TP
\fB\-V,\ \-\-verbose\fR

execution.
.TP
[\fBTCTI OPTIONS\fR ]
This collection of options are used to configure the varous TCTI modules
available.
.TP
\fB\-T,\ \-\-tcti\fR
Select the TCTI used for communication with the next component down the TSS
stack.
In most configurations this will be the TPM but it could be a simulator or
proxy.
Supported TCTIs are
.if (\n[HAVE_TCTI_DEV]) or \fB\*(lqdevice\*(rq\fR
.if (\n[HAVE_TCTI_SOCK]) or \fB\*(lqsocket\*(rq\fR
\[char46]
.TP
.if (\n[HAVE_TCTI_DEV] \{
\fB\-d,\ \-\-device-file\fR
Specify the TPM device file for use by the device TCTI. The default is
/dev/tpm0.
\}
.if (\n[HAVE_TCTI_SOCK] \{
.TP
\fB\-R,\ \-\-socket-address\fR
Specify the domain name or IP address used by the socket TCTI. The default
is 127.0.0.1.
.TP
\fB\-p,\ \-\-socket-port\fR
Specify the port number used by the socket TCTI. The default is 2321.
\}
.TP
\fBENVIRONMENT: TCTI\fR
This collection of environment variables that may be used to configure the
varous TCTI modules available.
The values passed through these variables can be overridden on a per-command
basis using the available command line options.
.TP
\fBTPM2TOOLS_TCTI_NAME\fR
Select the TCTI used for communication with the next component down the TSS
stack.
In most configurations this will be the TPM but it could be a simulator or
proxy.
See '\fBOPTIONS\fR' section for the names of supported TCTIs.
.TP
.if (\n[HAVE_TCTI_DEV] \{
